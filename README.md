squaddie
========

A little AI Game.

The idea behind squaddie is that player's write code that responds to a goal. In the actual game, when a squad member recieves this goal it will use the player written code.
The ultimate goal is to create a networked game in which players compete against each other by writing their own squad intelligence.
